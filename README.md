# Think Stats 2 - Notes  

This repository contains my personal notes and notebooks based on the book **Think Stats 2** by Allen B. Downey. These notes are intended to complement the book, offering insights, code explanations, and additional resources for understanding the material.  

## Requirements  

To run these notebooks without errors (e.g., import or data-related errors), you'll need to:  
1. Clone the official **Think Stats 2** repository by the author:  
   [Think Stats 2 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2)  
2. Place my notebooks inside the `ThinkStats2/code` directory of the cloned repository.  

This setup ensures that all required files and data are correctly located for smooth execution of the notebooks.  

## Purpose  

The notes in this repository are:  
- A study resource for better understanding statistical concepts.  
- A way to reinforce key ideas from the book with hands-on coding examples.  

## Credits  

All datasets and some code snippets belong to the original **Think Stats 2** repository by Allen B. Downey.  

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these notes as you dive deeper into statistics and data analysis!
