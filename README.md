- Introduction to statistics
- Probability theory
- Descriptive statistics
- Statistical distributions
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression and correlation
- Data analysis techniques

## Repository Structure

- **`RequiredMaterial/`**: This directory contains the material required to run the code examples and exercises in the notebooks. It includes datasets, test cases, and Python modules referenced in the notebooks.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the notebooks to find the topic or chapter you want to explore.
2. **Important**: To execute the code in the notebooks, move the notebooks to the `RequiredMaterial` directory before running them. This ensures that system paths are correctly set and avoids import errors related to Python modules and datasets.
3. Review the examples and exercises in the notebooks to apply the concepts learned.
4. Feel free to fork the repository and contribute if you find any areas for improvement!
